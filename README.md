The Re-creation Project, its like photorealism for the non-artist. 

In this project, I take interesting or unique visualisations that I find online and re-create them from scratch using the source data. The purpose is to broaden my data-viz skills by focusing my attention to each and every design element in a given chart. At times, I will provide commentary or feedback on certain design decisions along the way.
